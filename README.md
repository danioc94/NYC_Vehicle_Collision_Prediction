# NYC Vehicle Collision Prediction

# Reason of the Project and questions to be answered
The goal of this project is to predict the number of accidents that will occur during the year XXX by training a machine learning model that will read in data from the years XXX â€“ XXX. Additionally, we want to determine during which periods of time do accidents occur more, as well as finding which borough is more dangerous to drive.
Answering the above questions can provide insights on how often and where accidents will happen in the nearby future. This can be used to help the NYPD and local agencies to draft out solutions to prevent future accidents.
