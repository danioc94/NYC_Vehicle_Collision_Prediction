# NYC Vehicle Collision Prediction

# Selected Topic
The goal of this project is to predict the number of accidents that will occur during the year XXX by training a machine learning model that will read in data from the years XXX – XXX.

#Questions to be answered
Additionally, we want to determine during which periods of time do accidents occur more, as well as finding which borough is more dangerous to drive. Answering the above questions can provide insights on how often and where accidents will happen in the nearby future. This can be used to help the NYPD and local agencies to draft out solutions to prevent future accidents.

# Description of the data
To determine the above, we will use the “Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crash” dataset provided by the NYPD which is updated weekly with collision reports for over $1000 or injuries or fatalities have occurred. The dataset includes 1,935,922 rows of information for the years 2012, and 2016-present including information such as time of incident, location, injuries, fatalities, and cause of the accident.

# Communication Protocol

We will communicate through Slack during class hours as well as when needed. We will discuss challenges that are being faced for each deliverable.

# Current roles

- Sam: Circle
- Yuyu: Triangle
- Daniel: Square
- Subrata: X

# Machine Learning Model

For our machine learning model, we will be using a linear regression model. We chose this model because we want to predict how often crash happen and location.  Our y- variable will be the number of accidents with injuries and fatalities, the input will be time and borough.
